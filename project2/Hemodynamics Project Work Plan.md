**Hemodynamics Project Work Plan**

* Submit jobs and monitor progress [Yue]
* Convert VTK .vtu files into Numpy arrays.  Follow format similar to Rayleigh-Benard Convection project. [JGB]
* Compute drug delivery q(t) [MSE]
* Plot q(t) [MSE]
* Plot velocity field v(z, t) [MSE]
* Visuals for velocity field at selected z and t [MSE]
* Visualize red blood cells tumbling (still image) [Yue]
* Compute bolus function B(z, t) [TBD]
* Visuals for bolus at select points [TBD]
* [Optional] Movie of how fluids evolve; must show drug concentration, red blood cells options [Yue]
* [Optional] Schlieren visualization [TBD, time permitting]
* Report; [MSE first draft; rest of team revisions]
* Presentation; [TBD; adapted from report]
