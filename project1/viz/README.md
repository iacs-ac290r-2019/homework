For testing the Python visualization code on the local machine, you need to put the test.exo file in the same directory as the Python script, which can be found in the slack channel


### install the package
pip install netcdf4


### create directories to save each fields by frame
mkdir temp_frames

mkdir ux_frames

mkdir uy_frames

mkdir p_frames


### load the .exo file
test.exo is the small one

case1.exo is the large one

This path is subject to change, and eventually will be pointing at the case1.exo with 1024 core on Odyssey.
